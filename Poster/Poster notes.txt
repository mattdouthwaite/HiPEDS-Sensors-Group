Purpose:
- Showcase the work we've done
- Get our work assessed
- Give a high-level view of the resources we're providing

Audience:
- Ben and Krysia (for marking)
- HiPEDS advisory board + Freescale + MathWorks
__________

*** What we've done:

Bluetooth:
- Ben bought us two HC-05
- We bought a regular USB Bluetooth dongle
- We bought wires and connectors
- Hardware connections to the Freedom board
- C + MATLAB code and Simulink block to transmit data from the car
- Simulink block to pack data into byte packet structure
- MATLAB code and Simulink block to receive, synchronize and unpack data on the PC
- Simulink Bluetooth library

RPM Sensor:
- Chose type of sensor (Hall Effect)
- Chose and bought the HES: A1120EUA-T
- Chose and bought the magnets: 2x1mm N42 neodymium magnets
- Hardware connections to the Freedom board
- Established a way to attach magnets to wheels
- Developed an algorithm to estimate the angular speed from the sensor's digital signal
- C + MATLAB code and Simulink block to read left/right wheel RPM

Ambient Light Sensor:
- Chose and bought the light sensor
- Hardware connections to the Freedom board
- Simulink block to condition raw sensor input

- Simulink sensor library

Deliverables:
- Bluetooth and sensors Simulink libraries
- Hardware guidelines on how to physically set up and connect the BT module and sensors
