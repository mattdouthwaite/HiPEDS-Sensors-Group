Intro
- Context (Freescale Cup)
- Problem
- Our solution

Bluetooth
- Why BT?
- Why HC-05?
- General principles of BT comm. (serial, async.)
- Problems with async. comm. (misaligned bytes)
- Our proposed packet structure
- Step-by-step connection (show sine>pack>BT Tx ))) PC BT Rx)

Additional Sensors
- Now that we have a reliable comm. link, we thought of adding more sources of data
- Improve closed-loop control with additional sensors

RPM Sensor
- Direct feedback for how fast each wheel is spinning in response to the motors' control signal
- Contactless rotation counter
- IR vs. HE
- Algorithm

Ambient Light Sensor
- Motivation
- Analogue photodiode sensitive to visible light
- Hightlight how easy it is to incorporate new types of sensor

Deliverables
- Hardware guidelines
- Bluetooth Simulink blocks
- Sensors Simulink blocks
- High-level view (show complete model)
